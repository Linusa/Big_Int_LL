This program can add and subtract integers of any size, using linked lists. This
program was for Computer Science 1, and focuses on using pointers and lists. The
bigint.txt file contains sample input. The file format starts with a integer
representing the number of operations to perform. Each operation will be represented
by 3 integers: the operator (1 for add and 2 for subtract) and the two operands.
